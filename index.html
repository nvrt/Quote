                        and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort
                        without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
                        devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and
                        who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and
